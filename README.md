> I am currently running a research project on no-/low-code development paltforms, as part of my dissertation. If you have ever used any kind of low-code platform, I'd love to hear from you! You can find more information about my study and get in touch with me [via my website](https://chrisyalamov.space/research).


# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrisyalamov

  -  Backendâ€” building and securing APIs
  -  Frontendâ€” React, Remix, TailwindCSS
  -  Developing low- and no-code platforms that let non-tech people create their own solutions/applications
- ðŸŒ± I'm **currently learning** about database internals (working through CMU's [Introduction to Database Systems course](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2025/))
- ðŸŒ± I **want to learn** more about Go

## My projects

You can browse through my GitHub profile to see some of the software projects I've worked on. You can also have a look at my [portfolio website](https://www.chrisyalamov.space).

### [Custodia](https://github.com/chrisyalamov/custodia)
A TypeScript library which helps implement an OAuth2 Authorization Token Grant flow, as an Identity Provider. It can be useful to developers building APIs which they want to give access to in accordance with RFC 6749.

### [Sinte](https://github.com/Revantpoint/sinte)
Part of a small side project which I hope to expand and make public at some point in the near future. Sinte is a tool for running user-defined workflowsâ€” a set of steps, defined in a JSON schema. Each step is executed in a V8 isolate and the workflow orchestrator offers basic flow-control capabilities (branching and looping).

*Currently reworking this project*

### Other projects
- [Portfolio](https://github.com/chrisyalamov/portfolio_website) | Retired version of my portfolio website, written in React and Next.js
- [AC_UWE_RefBuilder](https://github.com/chrisyalamov/AC_UWE_RefBuilder) | An Atlassian Confluence macro for generating and rendering academic references, compliant with the University of the West of England (UWE) Bristol's Harvard Referencing Format, in Confluence pages.  

  > Atlassian now recommends a different way of implementing Macros. See [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/writing-macros/) for up to date guidance. The code in this repository may no longer work.
